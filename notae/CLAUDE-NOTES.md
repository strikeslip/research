*******
Ultrathink is a special keyword in Claude Code that allocates the highest ‚Äòthinking budget‚Äô - 31,999 tokens - for complex reasoning. It‚Äôs one of several levels: ‚Äòthink‚Äô (4k tokens) < ‚Äòthink hard‚Äô (10k) < ‚Äòthink harder‚Äô < ‚Äòultrathink‚Äô (32k). Only works in Claude Code, not regular Claude chat.

=========

Many folks run Claude in multiple terminals simultaneously.

Also push it to the limit use Claude 4 Opus \+ Plan Mode \+ ultrathink. (The most powerful feature combo)

When you get those mechanics down then look into sub-agents & role sub-agents.
