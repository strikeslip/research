===================================

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Rainbow_in_Curved_Air

It is important that this work parsing seismic miniseed waveform data NOT use any external libraries > previous work has used seisplotjs@2.1.5/dist/seisplotjs.mjs and it just generates unneccessary bloat >> this is near realtime seismic waveform audio sonification and RULES are DO NOT change data collection and parsing of miniseed current script in any way whatsoever. This is light weight efficient pure web.    Next step is focus on the sonification composition enhancing this SOUND MUSIC work >> this is a new genre that expands on Music Concrete > name yet undecided!! This current script SEISTRONICA has a similar tone and chord structure to Terry Riley's "A Rainbow in Curved Air" > REF: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Rainbow_in_Curved_Air (18:39 length) So lets focus on expanding this. Now make suggestions how this current script can be expanded on with regard to musical sonification that is inspired by "A Rainbow in Curved Air" >> GO

MiniSEED is a data format used for archiving and exchanging seismological time series data. It's a stripped-down version of the Standard for the Exchange of Earthquake Data (SEED), specifically designed for real-time and archived seismological data. MiniSEED primarily contains waveform data, but it lacks the detailed metadata found in the full SEED format. >> http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AGUFMIN42B..01A/abstract

Agent Seismic Sound (ASS) is a living digital sound engineâ€”an autonomous generative research agent that listens to Earthâ€™s seismic activity and transforms it into evolving soundscapes. Rooted in the concept of sonification as communication, ASS draws from real-time seismic data, granular synthesis, and minimalist audio engineering. Its purpose is both scientific and poetic: to explore Earthâ€™s voice, unlock sub-audible language patterns, and push the boundaries of human perception. Leveraging LLMs, ASS becomes adaptiveâ€”an AI companion evolving in cyberspace, composing perpetual, resonant Earthcore muzak as an ambient digital archive of planetary motion.

Here's the direct link to the IRIS Dataselect Builder:

ðŸ‘‰ https://service.iris.edu/irisws/timeseries/1/builder

This tool helps you manually construct and test waveform requests by selecting:

    Network (e.g., IU)

    Station (e.g., ANMO)

    Location (e.g., 00 or leave blank)

    Channel (e.g., BHZ)

    Start/End times
